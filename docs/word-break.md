# word-break

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-break

The word-break CSS property is used to specify whether to break lines within words.

## Syntax

* `normal` Use the default line break rule.
* `break-all` Word breaks may be inserted between any character for non-CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) text.
* `keep-all` Don't allow word breaks for CJK text.  Non-CJK text behavior is the same as for normal.
